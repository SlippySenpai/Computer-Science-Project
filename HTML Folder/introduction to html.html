	<h1>HyperText Markup Language or HTML</h1> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br> 

It defines the meaning and structure of web content.<br> 

Assisted by technologies such as cascading style sheets and scripting languages such as java script.<p>

There are so many different tags and attributes in html that helps us to create the page we desire.<p>
Examples of some of these are :- 
<A name="tags> </A>

<ol type="I">
	<ol>
<li> Img Src </li>
<li> A Href </li>
<li> Ordered List </li>
<li> Unordered List </li>
<li> Table Tags </li>
	</ol>
<P>

<font size = 5 color = yellow> A </font> nd many more.
<P>
	Using these tags we can create some of the most unique pages that one can imagine.
	<P>
<font size 7 color = Yellow> Now </font> Talking about its difficulty.<br> Is it beginner friendly?
<P>
	And Answer to that is.<font size = 6 color = red> Yes, </font> it is extremely beginner friendly.<br>
	Having some of the most simplest terminologies and the way of writing is easy as well. 
<p>

The only time that you are ever going to have problem with HTML is during CSS or (Cascading Style Sheet). Which we are going to be talking about later on.

<P> 
If you are interested in learning the basics of HTML.<P> You can look up these youtube videos:- 

<ul type=disc> 
	<li> <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD13eq_Pmp8&ab_channel=BroCode"> Learn HTML in One Hour </A> </li>
	<li> <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org"> Learn HTML - Full Tutorial For Beginners (2022) </A> </li>
</ul>
<P>

You can watch these videos to get a full understanding of how HTML works and how you are supposed to write an HTML.<br>
Then you would be able to understand where you are supposed to use these tags. <A href = "#tags"> Link to Tags Section of this page <i> i.e. </i> Tags </A>
<P>
<font size = 5 color = yellow> Now, </font> Let's talk about different languages of web programming.

<table align=center border="3" bordercolor="yellow" cellspacing="3" cellpading="3"> 
	<caption> Different Languages of web programming and designing.  </caption>
<P>
<tr>
	<td> <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"> JavaScript </A> </td>
	<td> <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"> Cascading Style Sheet </A> </td>
	<td> <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"> Structured Query Language </A> </td> 
	<td> <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"> Python </A> </td>
</tr>

<P>

<ul type="disc"> 
	<li> <H3> <font color = Grey> You can find this table at the bottom of the page </font> </H3> </li>
	<li> <font color = grey> JavaScript </font> :- JavaScript Helps in making the web pages interactive. It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia etc. </li> 

<li> <font color = yellow> Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) </font> :- It uses a separate language from HTML. CSS Allows you to apply consistent styling of elements across all pages on your site, so that all headings, lists, and paragraphs look and act the same on every page of a site. </li>

<li> <font color = red> Structured Query Language (SQL) </font> :- SQL is a database management system used to create and manage servers. With SQL programming language knowledge, you can easily navigate through massive amounts of data and understand how to retrieve data from a web application. Knowing SQL will allow you to extract information from website quickly. </li>

<li> <font color = green> Python </font> :- Python Web Application development typically employs python framweworks to construct its backend. These tasks, including parsing HTTP requests and creating responses; accessing databases: authenticating users; authorizing access; etc. </li>

	</ul>

<P>

Using these different languages we can make our own unique webpages, create some of the most unique yet, interactive websites and webpages, that we desire.

I Hope, this page helped you to understand the basics of HTML and introduced you to a whole new world of programming and design that you can use to let your imagination flow.
